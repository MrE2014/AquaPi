Aquapi is a RaspberryPi controlled aquaponics system that is aimed to be self suficient and self maintaining, with little interaction from a person. 
Still in it's infancy, it shows great appitude to be much more.
It as been designed and envisioned as a class project by the 2014 graduating class of the WCJC Electronics Engineering Tech program.

**Disclamer: Aquaponics is not the same thing as Hydroponics. They operate on the same idea of cultivating plants without soil, but Aquaponics also incorporates cultivating fish and using them as a nutrient source.**

Aquapi is a RaspberryPi controlled aquaponics system that is aimed to be self suficient and self maintaining, with little interaction from a person. Still in it's infancy, it shows great aptitude to be much more.

It as been designed and envisioned as a class project by the 2014 graduating class of the WCJC Electronics Engineering Tech program.

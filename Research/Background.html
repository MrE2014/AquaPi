<FONT FACE="Arial, serif">	Aquaponics is a combination of raising
fish and hydroponics (growing plants in water and without soil),
together in one integrated system. In this system, fish waste
provides organic food for the plants and in return the plants filter
the water in which the fish live. Fish waste contains ammonia, which
is harmful to fish and useless to plants. But beneficial bacteria
converts this ammonia into nitrites and then into nitrates. These
nitrates are relatively harmless to fish and make great plant food.
Both the plants and fish benefit from this relationship.</FONT></P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.11in; line-height: 105%; widows: 2; orphans: 2">
<FONT FACE="Arial, serif">An aquaponics system is highly productive
and conserves both water and land. If done correctly, plants will
grow bigger and faster because they will not have to work as hard to
obtain nutrients. Since the plant easily receives all the nutrients
it needs, it will focus more on growing upstairs instead of expanding
the root system downstairs. An aquaponics system will also use much
less water than plants grown in soil and a typical fish tank, because
water from the fish tank will not need to be constantly changed to
remove waste and the plants are grown in an enclosed area, resulting
in less evaporation.</FONT></P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.11in; line-height: 105%; widows: 2; orphans: 2">
<FONT FACE="Arial, serif">To fully understand aquaponics, you first
need to understand how a hydroponics system works. Hydroponics is the
process of growing plants with nutrients and water, and without soil.
Plants don’t need soil, they simply need the nutrients, water, and
stability that soil provides. In a hydroponics system you provide the
nutrient solution and growing medium to anchor the roots. In an
aquaponics system, fish provide the nutrients needed. This gets rid
of the need for soil and with it, any chance of soil-borne pests and
diseases. Since this is a pure clean method of cultivation, it is
recommended to start your plants from seeds to prevent contamination.</FONT></P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.11in; line-height: 105%; widows: 2; orphans: 2">
<FONT FACE="Arial, serif">The roots system can hang directly in the
nutrient solution, be misted by it, or can be enclosed within a
container or trough which is filled with a substrate. A substrate is
a replacement for soil and can be many things including: perlite,
sand, sawdust, woodchips, clay balls,  pebbles or rock wool. The
substrate must provide a good water holding capacity but be porous
enough for gas exchange.</FONT></P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in; line-height: 105%; widows: 2; orphans: 2">
<FONT FACE="Arial, serif">	A hydroponics or aquaponics system can
provide complete control over the environment in which the plants
grow. Because of this, it can get somewhat expensive. Lighting and
temperature control can quickly add up in price. For this reason,
most hydroponic/aquaponic  gardeners are limited to only grow crops
that sell for a high price. Among these profitable crops are lettuce,
basil, and tomatoes. Tomatoes being the most commonly grown.</FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Arial, serif">	There are many reasons why we decided to
use goldfish. They are easy to maintain, cheap, and available almost
everywhere. They can also survive in the pH range required to grow
tomatoes. Although goldfish do best at a pH between 7.2 and 7.6, they
can easily survive anywhere between 6.0 and 8.0 pH. With gradual
changes to pH, they can even adapt to pH levels outside of this
range. However, any large sudden changes in pH can be bad for their
health.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in; line-height: 105%; widows: 2; orphans: 2">
<FONT FACE="Arial, serif">	 Water temperature is also very important
for the health of the fish. There are mixed opinions on the best
temperature range for goldfish, but anywhere between 60-70ºF is
safe. Outside of this range or any sudden large changes in
temperature can cause health problems for the fish. When the
temperature nears 50</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">
</FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial, serif">ºF, goldfish can become
almost catatonic. As water temperature nears 80ºF, the oxygen level
of the water drops too low. </FONT>
</P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.11in; line-height: 105%; widows: 2; orphans: 2">
<FONT FACE="Arial, serif">It is also important that the goldfish
receive a varied and high carbohydrate diet. It is suggested to only
feed them once a day to prevent overfeeding. It also helps to have
only one person do the feeding, to avoid any confusion about the last
time they were fed.  A goldfish’s stomach is about the size of its
eye. This can be useful in figuring out how much food they need.
However, the main problem with overfeeding is not the fish
overeating. If there is too much food in the tank, the goldfish will
most likely not eat it all. Any uneaten food will decay and can cause
multiple problems for the fish, such as lower oxygen levels, lower pH
levels, and the uneaten food will break down into large amounts of
ammonia and nitrites, which are extremely toxic to fish.</FONT></P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.11in; line-height: 105%; widows: 2; orphans: 2">
<FONT FACE="Arial, serif">It is also recommended that each fully
grown goldfish receives a minimum of 6-8 gallons of space and 50-75%
of this space is hiding places. Neither of these are required, but
they lower the stress of the fish, which improves their immune
system. Doing this does not take much effort and can improve the
health of the fish.</FONT></P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.11in; line-height: 105%; widows: 2; orphans: 2">
<FONT FACE="Arial, serif">It is recommended to grow your tomato
plants from seeds if possible. Bringing plants from outdoors can
introduce pests and diseases to the aquaponics system. The seeds
should be planted in a nursery tray with a substrate, instead of
soil. The substrate should first be soaked with pH 4.5 water, then
the seed should be planted under the surface. When growing seeds, the
tray should be covered in a moist, warm area (68-77ºF).It should be
between 10-14 days before they are ready to be transported, and the
roots and leaves should be showing. When placing the plants, they
should be 10-12 inches apart.</FONT></P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in; line-height: 105%; widows: 2; orphans: 2">
<FONT FACE="Arial, serif">	There are many important factors when
growing tomatoes such as pH levels, temperature, and lighting. The pH
level should remain anywhere between 5.8 and 6.8. Anything outside of
this range can cause nutrient lockout. Nutrient lockout is when
plants are unable to absorb the nutrients they need. Lighting is also
important in growing tomatoes. Seedlings should receive at least 12
hours of light a day. Once fruit has set, it is suggested to increase
the amount of light it receives. At maturity, tomato plants require
about 16 hours of light to ensure maximum fruit production and an
eight hour respiration period of total darkness. The recommended
daytime temperature is between 64-77ºF. And the night time
temperature should be between 53-64ºF.</FONT></P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in; line-height: 105%; widows: 2; orphans: 2">
<FONT FACE="Arial, serif">	There are many common problems that can
occur when growing tomatoes. Yellow leaves can indicate that the
nutrient solution is not strong enough or the pH is too high causing
nutrient lockout. Leaf tips curled upwards or a red stem are results
of a magnesium deficiency caused by low pH. On the opposite side of
the spectrum, leaf tips curling downward is caused when the nutrient
level is too high. Another common problem is the flower falling off
before setting fruit. This can be cause by a potassium deficiency and
can be solved by adjusting the pH level or nutrient solution.</FONT></P>
